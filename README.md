Social media platforms have become a crucial means of exchanging information and communicating with others, offering a vast repository of data on various topics. Twitter, for example, is home to a wealth of tweets containing a wide range of information. To investigate sentiments expressed 
on Twitter during the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, I utilized a publicly available dataset from Kaggle consisting of 22,524 English tweets with the hashtag WorldCup2022. I employed Natural Language Processing techniques, namely VADER sentiment and Word Clouds, to determine the positive 
and negative sentiments surrounding the event. My findings indicate that while sports events tend to elicit positive emotions among the public, negative sentiments were also prevalent during this occasion as people were exhibiting their 
discontentment towards human and migrant rights in the host nation. My project has revealed that Natural Language Processing is an efficient approach for detecting public emotions from textual data.
